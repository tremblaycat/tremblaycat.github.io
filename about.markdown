Hello, my name is Catherine Tremblay! Like many Michiganders, I spend my days shoveling the arctic snow from my driveway and waiting for the sun to come out. Because this is of the upmost importance, I must tell you that I prefer cats to dogs, though I'm partial to all animals (except monkeys and apes and some humans). I can't wait to share my art, writing, and coding here in the dustiest corner of the internet.

P.S. I'm a brand new coder. Tech developer? Anyway, this is my first website which I'm thrilled about. Read more about my reasons for starting this site here: permalink https://tremblaycat.github.io/jekyll/update/2020/01/26/welcome-to-jekyll.html
