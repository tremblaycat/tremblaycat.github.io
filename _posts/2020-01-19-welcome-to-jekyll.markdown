**"The ship is cleared--my hour is come--my passengers are on board--and America is my haven.""**
-James Fenimore Cooper

Hello future Cat, I hope you enjoy this introductory post as you would an old friend someday. Your first website! How cute! To everyone else, here's some background:

I signed up for my Facebook account back when you had to be 13 (I lied and said I was a year older). I could never have imagined how much time I would spend on the internet. At 26, I've been in a relationship with social media for almost half of my life. It's an unsettling thought. For a long time, I imagined about what I would do without a social media: reading, writing, crafting, the list goes on and on. Lately, I've realized that this dream is within reach and always has been. I'm my only barrier. 

 Perhaps it's the romantic in me. I was obsessed with Jane Austen and British literature as a teenager, for how lovely it seems to be free of distractions! So, channeling my best Elizabeth Bennet, I'm going to put my foot down and devote myself to books. I'm giving up all social media and becoming...well, I don't know yet, but it's gonna be fun.

This website will serve not only as my first experiment in coding, but also as a digital diary, my liberation from Mark Z. I'm eager to begin this journey!
